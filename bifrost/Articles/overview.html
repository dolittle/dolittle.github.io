<p>Bifrost targets the line of business type of application development. This space has very often requirements that
are somewhat different than making other types of applications. Unlike creating a web page with content, line of business
applications has more advanced business logic and rules associated with it. In addition, most line of business applications
tend to live for a long time once they are being used by users. Rewrites are often seldom in this space, as it involves a lot of
work to capture existing features in a new way. This often means that one needs to think more about the maintainability
of the product. In addition to this, in a fast moving world, code needs to built in a way that allows for rapidly
adapting to new requirements. It truly can be a life/death situation for a company if the company is not able to adapt
to market changes, competitors or users wanting new features. Traditional techniques for building software has issues
related to this - by design. N-tier architecture tends to mix concerns and responsibilities and thus leading to
software that is hard to maintain. According <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Brooks">Fred Brooks</a> and
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month">&quot;The Mythical Man-Month&quot;</a>, 90% of the cost
related to a typical system arise in the maintenance phase. This means that we should aim towards building our systems
in a way that makes the maintenance phase as easy as possible.</p>
<p>The goal of Bifrost is to help make this better. By focusing on well established software patterns and practices,
and sticking to them without compromise, we believe this is possible. Bifrost embraces a set of practices described 
in this article and tries to adhere to them fully.</p>

<p>MVVM is a variation of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Fowler">Martin Fowler&#39;s</a> <a href="http://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/PresentationModel.html">Presentation Model</a>.
Its the most commonly used pattern in XAML based platforms such as WPF, Silverlight, UWP, Xamarin and more.</p>
<h3 id="model">Model</h3>
<p>The model refers to state being used typically originating from a server component such as a database.
It is often referred to as the domain model. In the context of Bifrost, this would typically be the <a href="read_model.md">ReadModel</a>.</p>
<h3 id="view">View</h3>
<p>The view represents the structure and layout on the screen. It observes the ViewModel.</p>
<h3 id="viewmodel">ViewModel</h3>
<p>The ViewModel holds the state; the model and also exposes behaviors that the view can utilize.
In XAML the behaviors is represented by a <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.windows.input.icommand(v=vs.110).aspx">command</a>,
something that wraps the behavior and provides a point for execution but also the ability to check wether or not
it can execute. This proves very handy when you want to validate things and not be able to execute unless one is valid or is authorized.
Bifrost has the concept of commands, these are slightly different however. In fact, commands in Bifrost is a part of the domain.
It is the thing that describes the users intent. You can read more about them <a href="../Backend/Commands/introduction.html">here</a>.
In the Bifrost JavaScript frontend however, the type of properties found with the XAML platforms
can also be found here. Read more about the frontend commands <a href="../Frontend/JavaScript/commands.html">here</a>.</p>
<h3 id="binding">Binding</h3>
<p>Part of connecting the View with the ViewModel and enabling it to observe it is the concept of binding.
Binding sits between the View and the ViewModel and can with some implementations even understand when values change
and automatically react to the change. In XAML, this is accomplished through implementing interfaces like <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.componentmodel.inotifypropertychanged(v=vs.110).aspx">INotifyPropertyChanged</a>
and <a href="https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.collections.specialized.inotifycollectionchanged(v=vs.110).aspx">INotifyCollectionChanged</a>
for collections.</p>
<p>Bifrost have full client support for both XAML based clients and also for JavaScript / Web based.
For XAML and what is supported, read more in detail <a href="../Frontend/XAML">here</a>.
For the JavaScript support, Bifrost has been built on top of <a href="http://knockoutjs.com">Knockout</a> that provides <code>obervable()</code> and <code>observableArray()</code>.
Read more about the JavaScript support <a href="../Frontend/JavaScript">here</a>.</p>

<p>A traditional MVVM would look something like this:</p>
<p><img src="images/mvvm.png" alt="MVVM Architectural Diagram"></p>
<p>With the artifacts found in Bifrost and more separation in place with CQRS, the diagram looks slightly different</p>
