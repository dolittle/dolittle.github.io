<p>An <em>Aggregate</em> is an object or collection of objects (Entities and Value Objects) that must be treated as a single unit for the
purposes of a business transaction. The <em>Aggregate</em> will maintain all invariants for all objects that comprise the <em>Aggregate</em>,
enforcing all business rules internal to the <em>Aggregate</em>.</p>
<h1 id="aggregate-root">Aggregate Root</h1>
<p>All <em>Aggregates</em> have a single point of entry that is know as the root.  The <em>Aggregate Root</em> is the interface to the external world.
All interaction with an <em>Aggregate</em> is via the <em>Aggregate Root</em>.  As such, an <em>Aggregate Root</em> <strong>MUST</strong> have a globally unique identifier
within the system.  Other Entites that are present in the <em>Aggregate</em> but are not <em>Aggregate Roots</em> require only a locally unique
identifier, that is, an Id that is unique within the <em>Aggregate</em>.  For example, an <em>Order</em> will contain <em>Order Lines</em>.  The <em>Order</em> is
the <em>Aggregate Root</em> and must have a unique <em>Order Id</em>.  The <em>Order Lines</em> cannot be accessed directly.  Any updates to <em>Order Lines</em>
must be via the <em>Order</em>.  That is, you ask the <em>Order</em> to make the change to <strong>IT&#39;S</strong> <em>Order Line</em>.  An <em>Order Line</em> is only required to
be identifiable with the <em>Order</em> therefore it is permissible to have <em>Order Line Id</em>&#39;s such as 1,2,3 etc. on each order.  It is, of
course, valid to use a globally unique identifier onthe <em>Order Line</em> for persistence purposes, while having a locally unique candidate
key for presentation.</p>
<p>It is <strong>not permissible</strong> to have references to entities or value objects from an <em>Aggregate Root</em> other than the <em>Aggregate Root</em>
itself.  In a <em>CQRS</em> system, it is permissible, indeed required, to have read models that have data from one or more Aggregate Roots.</p>
<h2 id="modelling">Modelling</h2>
<p>The modelling of an <em>Aggregate Root</em> is based on the invariants that must be maintained when updating.  In our example above, an <em>Order</em>
will perform aggregate functions on the order lines (e.g. summing the totals, assigning ids, maintaining ordering, etc.) and therefore will
potentially update all order lines at the same time.  An <em>Aggregate</em> is essentially a business transaction and should include everything that has
to be kept consistent.</p>
<h2 id="system-invariants">System Invariants</h2>
<p>The <em>Aggregate</em> maintains only internal invariants.  It is not responsible for maintaining invariants between <em>Aggregates</em>.  For example, it
is not the responsiblity of the individual <em>Aggregate</em> to ensure that a <em>Username</em> is unique.  It is the responsibility of the <strong>System as a whole</strong>
to maintain these system invariants.  The exact mechanism it uses will depend on the invariant and the consequences of breaking them.</p>
<div class="NOTE"><h5>Note</h5><p>What you must learn is that these rules are no different that the rules of a computer system. Some of them can be bent. Others can be broken.
Morpheus, The Matrix</p>
<p>All rules are not created equal.  Business Rules are essentially business problems, not primarily technical problems.  It may be simpler and cheaper
to break a rule and then clean it up later in a compensating transaction, than to expend a lot of time, energy and money ensuring the rule is not broken.</p>

<h1 id="aggregate-roots-in-bifrost">Aggregate Roots in Bifrost</h1>
<p>Bifrost provides a base class <em>AggregateRoot</em> that implements functionality that makes it easier to rehydrate Aggregate Roots, generate events and persist these
to the Event Store.  The <em>AggregateRoot</em> is an implementation of an <a href="./Events/event_sourcing">Event Source</a>.  It is <em>recommended</em> that all your <em>Aggregate Root</em>
classes inherit from this class.</p>
<h2 id="state">State</h2>
<p>In Bifrost, an <em>Aggregate</em> is a purely <em>WRITE</em> concern.  It plays no roll in reading or presentation.  As such, an <em>Aggregate</em> <strong>must not</strong> expose any public
state, via variables or properties.  Neither should the <em>Aggregate</em> return any of its internal entities or values objects, even in a transient state.
The <em>Aggregate</em> is only required to keep such internal state that it requires to maintain its invariants.  Since no public state is exposed by the <em>Aggregate</em>
it does not need to keep in state values that are not</p>
<h2 id="identity">Identity</h2>
<p>All <em>AggregateRoot</em> classes must have a <em>Guid</em> key.  It is permissible to include other candidate keys, though these should have a map to the Guid.</p>
<h2 id="rehydration">Rehydration</h2>
<p><em>AggregateRoot</em>s are an <a href="Events/event_sourcing.html">Event Source</a> and their internal state is rehydrated from the persistance store by replaying the events associated
with this instance.  Bifrost distinguishes between <em>CommittedEventStream</em>s, which are persisted to the <a href="Events/event_store.html">Event Store</a> and <em>UncommittedEventStream</em>s
which are not persisted.  A <em>CommittedEventStream</em> can be replayed against an <em>AggregateRoot</em> and each <a href="Events/introduction.html">Event</a> re-applied.  Since the <a href="Events/introduction.html">Event</a>
is responsible for setting an internal state, the <em>AggregateRoot</em> will be returned to its actual state when all <a href="Events/introduction.html">Events</a> are re-applied.  The
<em>CommittedEventStream</em> is a perfect audit record of all changes of the <em>AggregateRoot</em>.</p>
